 * Installing GraphViz

In order to install GraphViz, I'd warmly recommend to install it via winget, which is available either from the Microsoft Store, 
or via https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.11692. Download and install the *.msixbundle file.

Then, type the following command in the terminal:

winget install graphviz

The latest version of the program is going to be installed in C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin

If you cannot or you do not want to follow this procedure, you can still see the resulting graphs in "https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline"
